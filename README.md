# Movie Watchlist

React Native app to keep track of movies I want to watch (and mostly just to learn react-native). Uses the OMDB API for all movie data.  
Used only functional components for this project as I wanted to get more familiar with hooks. This uses the Context API, which ended up being the part that took the longest to grok.

## Installation

This assumes you have local simulators/emulators set up for iOS and Android (or have expo installed on your physical device).

To run using expo clone this repo, and run the following from the cloned directory.

```bash
expo install
expo start
```

Press `i` in the terminal window to start iOS simulator or `a` for an Android emulator, or use the QR code to run on your own device.

## Usage

Should be pretty self explanatory. Search for a movie or TV show you want to watch, click "Add to Watchlist" from the movie's description page and it will be saved to your watchlist.

## License

If for some reason someone really wants to use this, go right ahead!
